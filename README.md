## My process

In this project, I applied what little knowledge I have of HTML and CSS, analyzing the image and my notes in detail to replicate the blog preview card

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thanks to this challenge, I was able to put into practice and reinforce my knowledge of Flexbox, better understand how padding, margin, and measurements like vw, vh, percentage, and BEM methodology work.

some important code snippets i learned/reinforced:

```css
@media (min-width: 375px){}

overflow: hidden;

display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
```

### Continued development

I will continue improving my use of semantic HTML, accessibility, and responsive design. I will improve code reuse by using the BEM methodology for cleaner code. I will continue practicing with Flexbox, box-sizing, and using metrics. I will learn grids, learn how to use media queries, and use pleasing colors with their respective palettes.
